Using the Google Maps API (or any similar API), create an app using React Native that has 2 textboxes: "from" and "to". These textboxes should utilize the Google Maps autocomplete API. After entering the 2 locations, a polyline should appear on a map view showing the outline for the directions between the 2 points.
